This is a project for the cloud computing assignment 1
This is a project under spring framework, so make sure that your eclipse is installed with Spring tool
Here is some steps to run the  code:
1. delete the dependency of twittercore-4.0.2.jar and twitterstream-4.0.2.jar in maven (This project use local repository to get this two jar, so this part of code doesn't work)
2. add dependency of twittercore-4.0.2.jar and twitterstream-4.0.2.jar to maven
3. run the application on web server

Actually, this is somewhat difficult to set appropriate environment for spring due to the dependency problem. If you failed to run the code, please contact lz2413@columbia.edu.
